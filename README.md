# Hackintosh with an AMD CPU and GPU 
**[WIP]**
 
 **This is not a guide** it is just a log on how I have managed to make this build and the issues I faced. 

**UPDATE:** I have managed to revive this project. I have had to buy a sata cable and a new hard-drive for this project.
I have removed the outdated information since I'll be doing this from scratch.

**UPDATE 2:** No this is not dead, I have managed to get Big Sur installed but I'm currently troubleshooting Montrery. I don't want to be forced to buy an SSD right now. I will post the config.plist for my Big Sur setup soon.

For an XFX RX 590, you will need to flash a PowerColor BIOS which should be done at your own risk. Otherwise Mac OS won't recognise your GPU.

I have used [this guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/xfx-rx-590-not-working-on-mojave.266821/post-1968190) to flash my GPU's BIOS. **REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR BIOS, IF YOU DO BRICK YOUR GPU THEN USE THE PHYSICAL SWITCH ON YOUR GPU TO SWITCH TO AN ORIGINAL BIOS.**
