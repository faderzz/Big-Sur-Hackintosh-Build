# Hackintosh with an AMD CPU and GPU 
**[WIP]**
 
 **This is not a guide** it is just a log on how I have managed to make this build and the issues I faced. 

**UPDATE:** I have managed to revive this project. I have had to buy a sata cable and a new hard-drive for this project.
I have removed the outdated information since I'll be doing this from scratch.

**UPDATE 2:** No this is not dead, I have managed to get Big Sur installed but I'm currently troubleshooting Montrery. I don't want to be forced to buy an SSD right now. I will post the config.plist for my Big Sur setup soon.

## Hackintosh Build Specs:

 - **Motherboard:** ASUS Prime B450+
 - **Graphics Card:** XFX RX 590 Fatboy
 - **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 2700x
 - **Storage:** 3TB Hitachi HDD
 - **Storage 2:** 1TB HDD for Mac OS
 - **Second Storage Device:** 256GB Corsair Force MP510 M.2 SSD
